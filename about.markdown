## Background

I am **Giuseppe La Tona**, and I received my B.S., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the **University of Palermo**, Italy, in 2006, 2009, and 2014, respectively. 

Currently, I am a tenured Researcher with the **[Institute of Marine Engineering (INM)](https://www.inm.cnr.it/)**, [Italian National Research Council (**CNR**)](https://www.cnr.it/), Palermo, where I previously held a postdoctoral fellowship.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- **Optimization algorithms** for energy management
- **Machine learning** for energy-related time-series forecasting
- Applications to:
  - Smart buildings
  - Smart vehicles
  - Microgrids

I have been involved in several national and European research initiatives, including programs under the **Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR)**.

## Research Projects

I have participated in several significant scientific projects:

### PRIN HEROGRIDS
I served as the **unit coordinator for INM** for the **HEROGRIDS project**. The Principal Investigator was Prof. Mattavelli of the University of Padua, with additional units at the University of Salerno and the University of Cassino.

The main objective of the HEROGRIDS project was energy efficiency optimization through a comprehensive design and control approach for smart nanogrids, such as those in future commercial, residential and industrial buildings. This was achieved by coordinating and optimizing system design at all hierarchical levels.

### National Projects (PNRR & PON)
- **Sustainable Mobility Center** (CNMS PNRR Spoke 3 â€“ waterways)
- **SCAFO 4.0** production project
- **AMELIE** - Advanced framework for Manufacturing Engineering and product Lifecycle Enhancement
- **NAUSICA** - Efficient ships through innovative low-carbon technological solutions (PON R&C)
- **Hydrogen Research Program** - PNRR Mission 2, Component 2 (Investment 3.5)
- **TETI** - Innovative technologies for maritime control, monitoring and safety (PON R&C)

## Publications & Professional Activities

I am the author of **over 40 journal and conference papers**, with more than **500 citations** (Google Scholar). 

### Editorial Activities
I serve as reviewer for leading journals, including:
- *Mathematics and Computers in Simulation* (Elsevier)
- *IEEE Access*
- *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems*
- *IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications*
- *Journal of Cleaner Production* (Elsevier)

I also serve as reviewer for international conferences:
- **Electrimacs**
- **IECON** (IEEE Industrial Electronics Conference)
- **ISIE** (IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics)
- **EEEIC** (IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering)
- **IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)**

### Professional Memberships & Roles
- **Senior Member** of IEEE
- Member of the **IEEE Computer and Industrial Electronics Societies**
- Member of technical and program committees of international conferences
- Scientific evaluator for the **Italian Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy (MIMIT)** within the **Fondo Crescita Sostenibile (FCS)** - a national fund supporting strategic R&D&I projects

## Teaching

### University Courses
In 2020, I taught **Numerical Methods for Engineering** (6 CFU, 54 hours, MAT/08) within the Bachelor's degree program in Energy Engineering at the **University of Palermo**. The course focused on fundamental programming in MATLAB and numerical computing, which are essential for implementing machine learning and optimization algorithms in my research areas.

### Specialized Training
From 2017 to 2023, I taught **Machine Learning** in the advanced course of the **Scientific Computing with MATLAB School**, organized annually by **U4Learn s.r.l** (the first university spin-off of the University of Palermo operating in e-learning solutions). 

This course introduced students to the fundamentals of machine learning with MATLAB, contributing to the dissemination of knowledge and skills that are increasingly important in both research and industry. The course was designed for university students, academics, professionals, and technicians. Notably, colleagues from various CNR institutes participated in different editions of the course.
